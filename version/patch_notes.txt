0.12
    MAJOR UPDATES
    - When exporting MEI facsimile:
        * the MEI zone of symbols include as label the agnostic symbol string
        * a IIIF manifest is generated and installed in the site muret.dlsi.ua.es/IIIF, with images served by a new Cantaloupe IIIF server at muret.dlsi.ua.es/images
        (in current version, for compatibility with MPEditor @ Measuring Polyphony, the page beginning facsimile references are pointing to the surface element
        instead of the page zone - this will be fixed when MPEditor currently handles this situation that does not allow correctly encoding images that include two pagesWithRegions)
    - New button added for exporting MEI files for the Measuring Polyphony project editor, that does not include rhythmic interpretations (issue #173)
